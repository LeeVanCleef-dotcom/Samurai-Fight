# fightingGameMultiplayer
 
Idea was taken from https://github.com/chriscourses/fighting-game (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqbNFMDRGQ), but the implementation differs quite. 
There is no going off the map anymore, the the jumping is limited to double jump at most, attack box positions are fixed so that it's fair for both players and the game itself is not time based. 

The main idea of the project is to implement the multiplayer version of the game through WebSockets (socket.io).
